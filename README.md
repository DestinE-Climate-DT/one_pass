# Description

Development and implementation of intelligent data reduction techniques to process streamed climate model output data on-the-fly to produce statistical summaries or derived computations, taking the needs of the use cases into account. (WP9)

This repo will document the development of the one-pass algorithms that will be written in Phython3.
