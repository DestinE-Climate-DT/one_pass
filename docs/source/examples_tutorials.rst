Examples and Tutorials 
==========================

Jupyter Notebooks 
------------------

We have provided a Jupyter notebook called "example_notebook_disk_data.ipynb" to show case the functionalities of the one_pass package. This notebook covers all the different statistics currently avaliable with the one_pass package over different time scales using a small data set saved to disk. It can be found in the `examples_and_notebooks <https://earth.bsc.es/gitlab/digital-twins/de_340/one_pass/-/tree/output_for_bias_corr/examples_and_notebooks>`__ folder. 

Python script 
---------------
In the same "examples and notebooks" folder there is also a "wrapper.py" script, which provides a short example of how the one_pass package should be cofigured in python.
