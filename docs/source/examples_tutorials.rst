Jupyter Notebooks 
------------------

We have provided a couple of Jupyter notebookes to show case the functionalities of the one-pass package. The main one, called "example_notebook_disk_data.ipynb", covers the different statistics over different time scales using a small data set saved to disk. It can be found in the `examples_and_notebooks <https://earth.bsc.es/gitlab/digital-twins/de_340/one_pass/-/tree/output_for_bias_corr/examples_and_notebooks>`__ folder. 

TODO: Note that the second notebook "example_notebook_aqua_reader.ipynb" shows the opa with the streaming simulator developed by `AQUA <https://github.com/oloapinivad/AQUA/tree/main>`__. In order to use this notebook you have installed the AQUA (WP7) repo. 

TODO: Delete the example notebook for bias correction.
